    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A great Caesar salad recipe gets its swagger from a great Caesar dressing recipe. Squeamish about raw egg yolks and anchovies? Sorry. Yolks are what give richness to the emulsion, while anchovies provide a briny blast (and that whole umami thing).
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>The Dressing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Croutons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups torn 1" pieces country bread, with crusts</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Lettuce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 romaine hearts, leaves separated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong><em>The Dressing</em></strong>: Chop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Croutons</em></strong>: Make your own. Tearing, not cutting the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Lettuce</em></strong>: Use whole leaves; they provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Cheese</em></strong>: Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>The Assembly</em></strong>: Skip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parm.
        </li>
    </ol>
